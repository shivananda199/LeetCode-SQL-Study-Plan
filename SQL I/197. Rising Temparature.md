Table: ```Weather```
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
```
 

Write an SQL query to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```

**Solution**
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Method 1: Using LAG() window function
WITH odt AS (
    SELECT *,
    LAG(temperature) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_temp,
    LAG(recordDate) OVER (ORDER BY recordDate) AS prev_recordDate 
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT id
FROM odt
WHERE temperature > prev_temp
AND DATEDIFF(recordDate, prev_recordDate) = 1;

# Method 2: Using SELF JOIN method
SELECT DISTINCT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature
ORDER BY w1.id;
```
