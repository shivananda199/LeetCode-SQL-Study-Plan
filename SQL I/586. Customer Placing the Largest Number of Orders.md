Table: ```Orders```
```
+-----------------+----------+
| Column Name     | Type     |
+-----------------+----------+
| order_number    | int      |
| customer_number | int      |
+-----------------+----------+
order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
```
 

Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
Orders table:
+--------------+-----------------+
| order_number | customer_number |
+--------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 1               |
| 2            | 2               |
| 3            | 3               |
| 4            | 3               |
+--------------+-----------------+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| customer_number |
+-----------------+
| 3               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 
The customer with number 3 has two orders, which is greater than either customer 1 or 2 because each of them only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number 3.
```
**Solution**
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH no_of_orders AS (
    SELECT
    customer_number,
    COUNT(order_number) AS order_cnt
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_number
    ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC
)
SELECT customer_number FROM no_of_orders LIMIT 1;

# Method 2
WITH no_of_orders AS (
    SELECT
    customer_number,
    COUNT(order_number) AS order_cnt
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_number
)
SELECT customer_number FROM no_of_orders
WHERE order_cnt = (SELECT MAX(order_cnt) FROM no_of_orders)

# Method 3
SELECT customer_number
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_number
ORDER BY COUNT(order_number) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
