Table: ```Enrollments```
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| course_id     | int     |
| grade         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(student_id, course_id) is the primary key of this table.
```
 

Write a SQL query to find the highest grade with its corresponding course for each student. In case of a tie, you should find the course with the smallest course_id.

Return the result table ordered by student_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
Enrollments table:
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 2          | 3         | 95    |
| 1          | 1         | 90    |
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 3          | 1         | 80    |
| 3          | 2         | 75    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+
Output: 
+------------+-------------------+
| student_id | course_id | grade |
+------------+-----------+-------+
| 1          | 2         | 99    |
| 2          | 2         | 95    |
| 3          | 3         | 82    |
+------------+-----------+-------+

```

**Solution**
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH max_grade AS (
    SELECT
    student_id,
    MAX(grade) AS student_max_grade
    FROM Enrollments
    GROUP BY student_id
), max_courses AS (
    SELECT
    e.student_id,
    e.course_id,
    e.grade
    FROM Enrollments e
    JOIN max_grade mg
    ON e.student_id = mg.student_id
    AND e.grade = mg.student_max_grade
)
SELECT
student_id,
MIN(course_id) AS course_id,
grade
FROM max_courses
GROUP BY student_id, grade
ORDER BY student_id;

# Method 2: USING ROW_NUMBER()
SELECT 
student_id, 
course_id, 
grade
FROM (
    SELECT *,
    row_number() over (PARTITION BY student_id ORDER BY grade DESC, course_id) as rn
    FROM enrollments
) as ranking
where rn = 1
order by student_id;

# Method 3: Using MAX() AS Window Function
WITH max_course AS (
    SELECT *, 
    MAX(grade) OVER (PARTITION BY student_id) as max_grade
    FROM Enrollments
)
SELECT 
student_id, 
MIN(course_id) as course_id, 
grade
FROM max_course
WHERE grade = max_grade
GROUP BY student_id
ORDER BY student_id;
