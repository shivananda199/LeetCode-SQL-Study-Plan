Table: Products
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
```
 

Write an SQL query to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
Output: 
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+

```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT *,
    IF(change_date<='2019-08-16', 0, 1) AS relative_date_val
    FROM Products
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY product_id, relative_date_val ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS rn
    FROM cte1
),
cte3 AS (
    SELECT
    product_id,
    new_price AS price
    FROM cte2
    WHERE rn = 1 AND change_date<='2019-08-16'
)
# LEFT JOIN: for getting products which doesn't have a change price log for a date less than '2019-08-16'
SELECT DISTINCT
p.product_id,
COALESCE(c.price, 10) AS price
FROM Products p
LEFT JOIN cte3 c ON p.product_id = c.product_id;
