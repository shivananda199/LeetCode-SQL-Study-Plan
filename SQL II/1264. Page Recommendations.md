+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user1_id      | int     |
| user2_id      | int     |

Table: ```Likes```
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |

Write an SQL query to recommend pages to the user with user_id = 1 using the pages that your friends liked. It should not recommend pages you already liked.

Return result table in any order without duplicates.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 6        | 1        |
+----------+----------+
Likes table:
+---------+---------+
| user_id | page_id |
+---------+---------+
| 1       | 88      |
| 2       | 23      |
| 3       | 24      |

| 2       | 77      |
| 3       | 77      |
| 6       | 88      |
+---------+---------+
Output: 
+------------------+
| recommended_page |
+------------------+
| 23               |
| 24               |
| 56               |
| 33               |
| 77               |

Explanation: 
User one is friend with users 2, 3, 4 and 6.
Suggested pages are 23 from user 2, 24 from user 3, 56 from user 3 and 33 from user 6.
Page 77 is suggested from both user 2 and user 3.
Page 88 is not suggested because user 1 already likes it.

```
**Solution**
```
WITH friends_likes AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
    page_id
    FROM Likes
    JOIN Friendship
    ON (user_id = user2_id AND user1_id = 1)
    OR (user_id = user1_id AND user2_id = 1)
) 
SELECT
page_id AS recommended_page
FROM friends_likes 
WHERE page_id NOT IN (SELECT page_id FROM Likes WHERE user_id = 1);

# Method 2: Using LEFT JOIN and NULL trick in place of NOT IN subquery
WITH friends_likes AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
    page_id
    FROM Likes
    JOIN Friendship
    ON (user_id = user2_id AND user1_id = 1)
    OR (user_id = user1_id AND user2_id = 1)
) 
SELECT
fl.page_id AS recommended_page
FROM friends_likes fl
LEFT JOIN (SELECT page_id FROM Likes WHERE user_id = 1) a
ON a.page_id = fl.page_id
WHERE a.page_id IS NULL;

# Method 3:
SELECT DISTINCT
page_id as recommended_page
FROM Likes
WHERE page_id NOT IN (SELECT page_id from Likes WHERE user_id = 1)
AND user_id IN 
(
    SELECT user1_id FROM Friendship WHERE user2_id = 1
    UNION
    SELECT user2_id FROM Friendship WHERE user1_id = 1
);
```
