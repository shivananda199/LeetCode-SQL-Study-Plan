Write an SQL query to find the team size of each of the employees.

Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
Employee Table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_id    |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     8      |
|     2       |     8      |
|     3       |     8      |
|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |
+-------------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |
|     3       |     3      |
|     4       |     1      |
|     5       |     2      |
|     6       |     2      |
+-------------+------------+
Explanation: 
Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
Employee with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.

```
**Solution**
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
    team_id,
    COUNT(*) AS emp_cnt
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY team_id
)
SELECT
employee_id,
emp_cnt AS team_size
FROM Employee e
JOIN cte ON e.team_id = cte.team_id;

# Method 2: Window function
SELECT
employee_id,
COUNT(team_id) OVER (PARTITION BY team_id) AS team_size
FROM Employee;
```
