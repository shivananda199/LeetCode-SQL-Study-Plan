(movie_id, user_id) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the rating of a movie by a user in their review.
created_at is the user's review date. 
```
 

Write an SQL query to:

    Find the name of the user who has rated the greatest number of movies. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller user name.
    Find the movie name with the highest average rating in February 2020. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller movie name.

The query result format is in the following example.

Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# WITH cte1 AS (
#     SELECT DISTINCT
#     user_id, movie_id
#     FROM MovieRating
# ), 
# cte2 AS (
#     SELECT

#     GROUP BY c1.user_id
#     ORDER BY movies_rated_cnt DESC, u.name
#     LIMIT 1
# )
# SELECT name AS results FROM cte2;
#
# CTEs don't work when there are UNION [ALL] statement. So, include them in subqueries AS below
#
SELECT 
name AS results
