Table: ```Customers```
```
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| customer_id         | int     |
| customer_name       | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_name is the name of the customer.
```
 

Table: ```Orders```
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| customer_id   | int     |
| product_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_id is the id of the customer who bought the product "product_name".
```
 

Write an SQL query to report the customer_id and customer_name of customers who bought products "A", "B" but did not buy the product "C" since we want to recommend them to purchase this product.

Return the result table ordered by customer_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |
| 2           | Diana         |
| 3           | Elizabeth     |
| 4           | Jhon          |
+-------------+---------------+
Orders table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| order_id   | customer_id  | product_name  |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| 10         |     1        |     A         |
| 20         |     1        |     B         |
| 30         |     1        |     D         |

| 90         |     4        |     C         |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 3           | Elizabeth     |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: Only the customer_id with id 3 bought the product A and B but not the product C.

```

**Solution**
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Method 1: straight forward
SELECT DISTINCT 
customer_id, 
customer_name
FROM Customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE product_name='A'
) 
AND customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE product_name='B'
) 
AND customer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM Orders
    WHERE product_name='C'
);

# Method 2: most efficient using JOINS
SELECT DISTINCT c.* 
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders oa ON c.customer_id = oa.customer_id
AND oa.product_name = 'A'
JOIN Orders ob ON c.customer_id = ob.customer_id 
AND ob.product_name = 'B'
LEFT JOIN Orders oc ON c.customer_id = oc.customer_id 
AND oc.product_name = 'C'
WHERE oc.order_id IS NULL;

# Method 3: clever one but cross product may result in memory overhead
SELECT a.customer_id, a.customer_name
FROM Customers a, Orders b
WHERE a.customer_id = b.customer_id
GROUP BY a.customer_id
HAVING sum(b.product_name="A") > 0 
AND sum(b.product_name="B") > 0 
AND sum(b.product_name="C") = 0;

#Method 4: GROUP_CONCAT()
WITH customer_products AS (
    SELECT
    customer_id,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product_name ORDER BY product_name) AS product_list
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT
cp.customer_id,
c.customer_name
FROM customer_products cp
JOIN Customers c
ON cp.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE product_list LIKE 'A,B%' AND product_list NOT LIKE 'A,B,C%'
ORDER BY customer_id;

# Method 5: EXISTS()
SELECT * 
FROM Customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM Orders oa
    WHERE c.customer_id = oa.customer_id
    AND oa.product_name = 'A'
)
AND EXISTS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM Orders ob
    WHERE c.customer_id = ob.customer_id
    AND ob.product_name = 'B'
)
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM Orders oc
    WHERE c.customer_id = oc.customer_id
    AND oc.product_name = 'C'
);
```
