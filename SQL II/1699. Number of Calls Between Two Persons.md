Table: ```Calls```
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| from_id     | int     |
| to_id       | int     |
| duration    | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table does not have a primary key, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the duration of a phone call between from_id and to_id.
from_id != to_id
```
 

Write an SQL query to report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons (person1, person2) where person1 < person2.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
Calls table:
+---------+-------+----------+
| from_id | to_id | duration |
+---------+-------+----------+
| 1       | 2     | 59       |
| 2       | 1     | 11       |
| 1       | 3     | 20       |
| 3       | 4     | 100      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 4       | 3     | 499      |
+---------+-------+----------+
Output: 
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| person1 | person2 | call_count | total_duration |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2       | 2          | 70             |
| 1       | 3       | 1          | 20             |
| 3       | 4       | 4          | 999            |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
Users 1 and 2 had 2 calls and the total duration is 70 (59 + 11).
Users 1 and 3 had 1 call and the total duration is 20.
Users 3 and 4 had 4 calls and the total duration is 999 (100 + 200 + 200 + 499).
```
**Solution**
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# UNION ALL to ensure duplicates aren't removed
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
    from_id AS person1,
    to_id AS person2,
    duration
    FROM Calls WHERE from_id < to_id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
    to_id AS person1,
    from_id AS person2,
    duration
    FROM Calls WHERE from_id > to_id
)
SELECT
person1,
person2,
COUNT(*) AS call_count,
SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM cte
GROUP BY person1, person2;

# Method 2 from submissions: clever use of GREATEST and LEAST functions.
# Also, good to know that MySQL and PostgreSQL allow using column aliases as GROUP By columns
SELECT 
LEAST(from_id, to_id) as person1,
GREATEST(from_id, to_id) as person2,
COUNT(*) as call_count,
SUM(duration) as total_duration
FROM Calls
GROUP BY person1, person2;
```
