Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Method 1: memory efficient
WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT year, Wimbledon AS player_id FROM Championships
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT year, Fr_open AS player_id FROM Championships
    UNION ALL
    SELECT year, US_open AS player_id FROM Championships
    UNION ALL
    SELECT year, Au_open AS player_id FROM Championships
)
SELECT
c.player_id,
p.player_name,
COUNT(*) AS grand_slams_count
FROM cte1 c
JOIN Players p 
ON c.player_id = p.player_id
GROUP BY c.player_id;

# Method 2
SELECT
player_id,
player_name,
SUM(player_id=Wimbledon)+SUM(player_id=Fr_open)+SUM(player_id=US_open)+SUM(player_id=Au_open) as grand_slams_count
FROM Players
JOIN Championships
ON player_id=Wimbledon or player_id=Fr_open or player_id=US_open or player_id=Au_open
GROUP BY player_id;
