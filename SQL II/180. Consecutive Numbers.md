Table: Logs
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column.
```

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT
    id,
    num,
    LAG(num, 2) OVER () AS prev_2_num,
    LAG(num, 1) OVER () AS prev_1_num,
    LEAD(num, 1) OVER () AS next_1_num,
    LEAD(num, 2) OVER () AS next_2_num
    FROM Logs 
)
SELECT DISTINCT
num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM cte1
WHERE (prev_2_num = prev_1_num AND prev_1_num = num)
OR (prev_1_num = num AND num = next_1_num)
OR (num = next_1_num AND next_1_num = next_2_num);

# Method 2: LeetCode Official Solution
# Consecutive appearing means the Id of the Num are next to each others. Since this problem asks for numbers appearing at least three times consecutively, we can use 3 aliases for this table Logs, and then check whether 3 consecutive numbers are all the same.

SELECT DISTINCT
    l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
;
```
