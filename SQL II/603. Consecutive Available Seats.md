Table: Cinema
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| seat_id     | int  |
| free        | bool |
+-------------+------+
seat_id is an auto-increment primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates whether the ith seat is free or not. 1 means free while 0 means occupied.
```
 

Write an SQL query to report all the consecutive available seats in the cinema.

Return the result table ordered by seat_id in ascending order.

The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Cinema table:
+---------+------+
| seat_id | free |
+---------+------+
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
+---------+------+
Output: 
+---------+
| seat_id |
+---------+
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
+---------+

```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT
    seat_id,
    CASE 
        WHEN (LAG(free) OVER () = 1
        OR LEAD(free) OVER () = 1)
        AND free != 0
        THEN 'yes' ELSE 'no'
    END AS is_cons_free
    FROM Cinema
)
SELECT
seat_id
FROM cte WHERE is_cons_free = 'yes'
ORDER BY seat_id;

# Method 2
SELECT DISTINCT 
c1.seat_id 
FROM Cinema c1 
JOIN Cinema c2 
ON c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id + 1 
OR c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id - 1
WHERE c1.free = 1 and c2.free = 1
ORDER BY c1.seat_id;

# Method 3
SELECT
seat_id
FROM 
(
    SELECT *,
    LAG(free, 1) OVER () AS prev_1,
    LEAD(free, 1) OVER () AS next_1
    FROM Cinema
) a
WHERE free = 1 AND prev_1 = 1
OR free = 1 AND next_1 = 1
ORDER BY seat_id;

# Method 4
SELECT
seat_id
FROM
(
    SELECT *,
    SUM(IF(free=1, 1, 0)) OVER (ORDER BY seat_id ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS prev_1_sum,
    SUM(IF(free=1, 1, 0)) OVER (ORDER BY seat_id ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS next_1_sum
    FROM Cinema
) a
WHERE prev_1_sum = 2 OR next_1_sum = 2
ORDER BY seat_id;
