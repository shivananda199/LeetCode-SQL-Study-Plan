Table: ```MyNumbers```
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each row of this table contains an integer.
```
 

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.

Write an SQL query to report the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output: 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.

```
**Solution**
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Method 1: alias for query result to return NULL in case of empty rows in subquery
SELECT (
    SELECT
    num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(*)=1
    ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 1
) AS num;

# Method 2: using MAX() - returns NULL in case of empty rows
SELECT 
MAX(num) AS num
FROM 
(
    SELECT
    num
    FROM MyNumbers
    GROUP BY num
    HAVING COUNT(*)=1
) n;
```
