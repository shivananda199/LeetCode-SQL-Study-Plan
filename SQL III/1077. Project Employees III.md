Write an SQL query that reports the most experienced employees in each project. In case of a tie, report all employees with the maximum number of experience years.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+
Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 3                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | employee_id   |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 1           | 3             |
| 2           | 1             |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation: Both employees with id 1 and 3 have the most experience among the employees of the first project. For the second project, the employee with id 1 has the most experience.

Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH emp_exp AS (
    SELECT 
    p.project_id, 
    p.employee_id,
    DENSE_RANK() over (PARTITION BY p.project_id ORDER BY experience_years DESC) as dr
    FROM Project p 
    JOIN Employee e
    on p.employee_id = e.employee_id
)
SELECT 
project_id, 
employee_id
FROM emp_exp
WHERE dr = 1;

# Method 2: without window function and subquery
WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT
    p.project_id, 
    p.employee_id,
    e.experience_years
    FROM Project p
    JOIN Employee e
    ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
), 
cte2 AS (
    SELECT
    project_id,
    MAX(experience_years) as max_exp_yr
    FROM cte1
    GROUP BY project_id
)
SELECT
c1.project_id,
c1.employee_id
FROM cte1 c1
JOIN cte2 c2
ON c1.project_id = c2.project_id
AND c1.experience_years = c2.max_exp_yr;
