Table: Failed
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| fail_date    | date    |
+--------------+---------+
fail_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of failed tasks.
```
 

Table: Succeeded
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| success_date | date    |
+--------------+---------+
success_date is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the days of succeeded tasks.
```
 

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.

Write an SQL query to generate a report of period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as start_date and end_date.

Return the result table ordered by start_date.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Failed table:
+-------------------+
| fail_date         |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-28        |
| 2018-12-29        |
| 2019-01-04        |
| 2019-01-05        |
+-------------------+
Succeeded table:
+-------------------+
| success_date      |
+-------------------+
| 2018-12-30        |
| 2018-12-31        |
| 2019-01-01        |
| 2019-01-02        |
| 2019-01-03        |
| 2019-01-06        |
+-------------------+
Output: 
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| period_state | start_date   | end_date     |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| succeeded    | 2019-01-01   | 2019-01-03   |
| failed       | 2019-01-04   | 2019-01-05   |
| succeeded    | 2019-01-06   | 2019-01-06   |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
The report ignored the system state in 2018 as we care about the system in the period 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.
From 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-03 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
From 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-05 all tasks failed and the system state was "failed".
From 2019-01-06 to 2019-01-06 all tasks succeeded and the system state was "succeeded".
```
Approach:
```
step 1: union both tables
step 2: contiguous dates with same status will have same group_id
second cte output:
| date       | status    | group_id |
| ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| 2019-01-01 | succeeded | 0        |
| 2019-01-02 | succeeded | 0        |
| 2019-01-03 | succeeded | 0        |
| 2019-01-04 | failed    | 3        |
| 2019-01-05 | failed    | 3        |
| 2019-01-06 | succeeded | 2        |
step 3: group by status and group_id, get min and max dates
```
Solution
```
WITH union_cte AS (
    SELECT
    fail_date AS date,
    'failed' AS status
    FROM Failed
    WHERE fail_date between '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
    success_date AS date,
    'succeeded' AS status
    FROM Succeeded
    WHERE success_date between '2019-01-01' AND '2019-12-31'
),
rn_cte AS (
    SELECT *,
    (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY date)) - (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY status ORDER BY date)) AS group_id
    FROM union_cte
)
SELECT
status AS period_state,
MIN(date) AS start_date,
MAX(date) AS end_date
FROM rn_cte
GROUP BY period_state, group_id
ORDER BY start_date;
```
