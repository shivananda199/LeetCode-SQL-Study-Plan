Table: Logs
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| log_id        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
log_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.
```
 

Write an SQL query to find the start and end number of continuous ranges in the table Logs.

Return the result table ordered by start_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Logs table:
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 7          |
| 8          |
| 10         |
+------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+
| start_id   | end_id       |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 3            |
| 7          | 8            |
| 10         | 10           |
+------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
The result table should contain all ranges in table Logs.
From 1 to 3 is contained in the table.
From 4 to 6 is missing in the table
From 7 to 8 is contained in the table.
Number 9 is missing from the table.
Number 10 is contained in the table.

```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT
    log_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER () AS rn
    FROM Logs
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT
    log_id,
    abs(log_id - rn) AS diff
    FROM cte1
)
SELECT
MIN(log_id) AS start_id,
MAX(log_id) AS end_id
FROM cte2
GROUP BY diff
ORDER BY start_id;
```
