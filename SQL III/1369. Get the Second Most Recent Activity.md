Table: UserActivity
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| username      | varchar |
| activity      | varchar |
| startDate     | Date    |
| endDate       | Date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
This table contains information about the activity performed by each user in a period of time.
A person with username performed an activity from startDate to endDate.
```
 

Write an SQL query to show the second most recent activity of each user.

If the user only has one activity, return that one. A user cannot perform more than one activity at the same time.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
UserActivity table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-12  | 2020-02-20  |
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Alice      | Travel       | 2020-02-24  | 2020-02-28  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| username   | activity     | startDate   | endDate     |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
| Alice      | Dancing      | 2020-02-21  | 2020-02-23  |
| Bob        | Travel       | 2020-02-11  | 2020-02-18  |
+------------+--------------+-------------+-------------+
Explanation: 
The most recent activity of Alice is Travel from 2020-02-24 to 2020-02-28, before that she was dancing from 2020-02-21 to 2020-02-23.
Bob only has one record, we just take that one.
```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte AS (
SELECT *,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY username ORDER BY endDate DESC) rk,
COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY username) cnt
FROM UserActivity
)
SELECT
username,
activity,
startDate,
endDate
FROM cte
WHERE rk=2 OR cnt=1;
```
