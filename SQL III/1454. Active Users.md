Table: Accounts
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the account id and the user name of each account.
```
 

Table: Logins
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| login_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.
```
 

Active users are those who logged in to their accounts for five or more consecutive days.

Write an SQL query to find the id and the name of active users.

Return the result table ordered by id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |
+----+------------+
| 7  | 2020-05-30 |
| 1  | 2020-05-30 |
| 7  | 2020-05-31 |
| 7  | 2020-06-01 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+
Output: 
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
Explanation: 
User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.
```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Method 1: self-join - inefficient
SELECT DISTINCT
l.id,
a.name
FROM Logins l
JOIN Logins l1 ON l.id = l1.id AND l.login_date = DATE_ADD(l1.login_date, INTERVAL -1 DAY)
JOIN Logins l2 ON l.id = l2.id AND l.login_date = DATE_ADD(l2.login_date, INTERVAL -2 DAY)
JOIN Logins l3 ON l.id = l3.id AND l.login_date = DATE_ADD(l3.login_date, INTERVAL -3 DAY)
JOIN Logins l4 ON l.id = l4.id AND l.login_date = DATE_ADD(l4.login_date, INTERVAL -4 DAY)
JOIN Accounts a ON l.id = a.id
ORDER BY l.id;
```
Method 2: mid-range performance
```
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
    SELECT
    1 AS rn,
    (SELECT MIN(login_date) FROM Logins) AS rec_date
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
    rn + 1,
    DATE_ADD(rec_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
    FROM cte
    WHERE rn + 1 <= (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT id, login_DATE FROM Logins) dl)
),
login_cte AS (
    SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY login_date) AS rn
    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT id, login_date FROM Logins) dl
),
cte_join_tbl AS (
    SELECT
    id,
    login_date,
    rec_date,
    DATEDIFF(login_date, rec_date) AS date_diff
    FROM login_cte lc
    JOIN cte c ON lc.rn = c.rn
)
SELECT DISTINCT
cj.id, 
a.name
FROM cte_join_tbl cj
JOIN Accounts a ON cj.id = a.id
GROUP BY cj.id, date_diff
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;
