Write an SQL query to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.

The result table should have the product_id and product_name for each customer_id who ordered at least one order.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Customers table:
+-------------+-------+
| customer_id | name  |
+-------------+-------+
| 1           | Alice |
| 2           | Bob   |
| 3           | Tom   |
| 4           | Jerry |
| 5           | John  |
+-------------+-------+
Orders table:
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | product_id |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 1          |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 2          |
| 3        | 2020-08-29 | 3           | 3          |
| 4        | 2020-07-29 | 4           | 1          |
| 5        | 2020-06-10 | 1           | 2          |
| 6        | 2020-08-01 | 2           | 1          |
| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 3          |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 2          |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 3          |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2          |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
Products table:
+------------+--------------+-------+
| product_id | product_name | price |
+------------+--------------+-------+
| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |
| 3          | screen       | 600   |
| 4          | hard disk    | 450   |
+------------+--------------+-------+
Output: 
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| customer_id | product_id | product_name |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| 1           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 1          | keyboard     |
| 2           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 3          | screen       |
| 3           | 3          | screen       |
| 4           | 1          | keyboard     |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
Alice (customer 1) ordered the mouse three times and the keyboard one time, so the mouse is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Bob (customer 2) ordered the keyboard, the mouse, and the screen one time, so those are the most frequently ordered products for them.
Tom (customer 3) only ordered the screen (two times), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Jerry (customer 4) only ordered the keyboard (one time), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
John (customer 5) did not order anything, so we do not include them in the result table.

```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH prod_cnt_tbl AS (
    SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    COUNT(product_id) AS prod_cnt
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, product_id
),
max_prod_cnt_tbl AS (
    SELECT
    customer_id,
    MAX(prod_cnt) AS max_prod_cnt
    FROM prod_cnt_tbl
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT
pct.customer_id,
pct.product_id,
p.product_name
FROM prod_cnt_tbl pct
JOIN Products p
ON pct.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE pct.prod_cnt = (SELECT max_prod_cnt FROM max_prod_cnt_tbl WHERE customer_id = pct.customer_id);

# Method 2: Using Dense Rank
WITH prod_cnt_tbl AS (
    SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    COUNT(product_id) AS prod_cnt
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY customer_id, product_id
),
prod_cnt_rk_tbl AS (
    SELECT
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY prod_cnt DESC) AS rk
    FROM prod_cnt_tbl
)
SELECT
pcrt.customer_id,
pcrt.product_id,
p.product_name
FROM prod_cnt_rk_tbl pcrt
JOIN Products p
ON pcrt.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE rk = 1;
```
