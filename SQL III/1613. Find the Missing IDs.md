Table: Customers
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| customer_name | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id customer.
```
 

Write an SQL query to find the missing customer IDs. The missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.

Notice that the maximum customer_id will not exceed 100.

Return the result table ordered by ids in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 4           | Bob           |
| 5           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+
Output: 
+-----+
| ids |
+-----+
| 2   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Explanation: 
The maximum customer_id present in the table is 5, so in the range [1,5], IDs 2 and 3 are missing from the table.

```
Solution

```
# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH RECURSIVE gen AS (
    SELECT 1 AS ids
    UNION ALL
    SELECT ids+1 FROM gen WHERE ids+1<=(SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM Customers)
)
SELECT
ids
FROM gen
WHERE ids NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Customers)
ORDER BY ids;
```
