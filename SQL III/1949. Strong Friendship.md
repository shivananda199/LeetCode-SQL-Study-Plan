Table: Friendship
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user1_id    | int  |
| user2_id    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the users user1_id and user2_id are friends.
Note that user1_id < user2_id.
```
 

A friendship between a pair of friends x and y is strong if x and y have at least three common friends.

Write an SQL query to find all the strong friendships.

Note that the result table should not contain duplicates with user1_id < user2_id.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 1        | 5        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 1        | 7        |
| 3        | 7        |
| 1        | 6        |
| 3        | 6        |
| 2        | 6        |
+----------+----------+
Output: 
+----------+----------+---------------+
| user1_id | user2_id | common_friend |
+----------+----------+---------------+
| 1        | 2        | 4             |
| 1        | 3        | 3             |
+----------+----------+---------------+
Explanation: 
Users 1 and 2 have 4 common friends (3, 4, 5, and 6).
Users 1 and 3 have 3 common friends (2, 6, and 7).
We did not include the friendship of users 2 and 3 because they only have two common friends (1 and 6).

```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below

# we need user1_id, user2_id combination where user1_id>user2_id, otherwise we will count of common friends for cases like (1,2), (2,3). Here, to get 2 as common friend of both 1 and 3 in final join, we need a record (3, 2) in from cte.
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT user1_id, user2_id FROM Friendship
    UNION
    SELECT user2_id AS user1_id, user1_id AS user2_id FROM Friendship
)
SELECT
f.user1_id,
f.user2_id,
COUNT(*) AS common_friend
FROM Friendship f
JOIN cte c1 ON f.user1_id = c1.user1_id
JOIN cte c2 ON f.user2_id = c2.user1_id AND c1.user2_id = c2.user2_id
GROUP BY f.user1_id, f.user2_id
HAVING COUNT(*)>=3;
