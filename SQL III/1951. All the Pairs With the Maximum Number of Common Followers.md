Table: Relations
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| follower_id | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user_id, follower_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID follower_id is following the user with ID user_id.
```
 

Write an SQL query to find all the pairs of users with the maximum number of common followers. In other words, if the maximum number of common followers between any two users is maxCommon, then you have to return all pairs of users that have maxCommon common followers.

The result table should contain the pairs user1_id and user2_id where user1_id < user2_id.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Relations table:
+---------+-------------+
| user_id | follower_id |
+---------+-------------+
| 1       | 3           |
| 2       | 3           |
| 7       | 3           |
| 1       | 4           |
| 2       | 4           |
| 7       | 4           |
| 1       | 5           |
| 2       | 6           |
| 7       | 5           |
+---------+-------------+
Output: 
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 7        |
+----------+----------+
Explanation: 
Users 1 and 2 have two common followers (3 and 4).
Users 1 and 7 have three common followers (3, 4, and 5).
Users 2 and 7 have two common followers (3 and 4).
Since the maximum number of common followers between any two users is 3, we return all pairs of users with three common followers, which is only the pair (1, 7). We return the pair as (1, 7), not as (7, 1).
Note that we do not have any information about the users that follow users 3, 4, and 5, so we consider them to have 0 followers.

```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT
    r1.user_id AS user1_id,
    r2.user_id AS user2_id,
    r1.follower_id
    FROM Relations r1
    JOIN Relations r2
    ON r1.follower_id = r2.follower_id
    AND r1.user_id < r2.user_id
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT
    user1_id,
    user2_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT follower_id) AS common_cnt
    FROM cte1 
    GROUP BY user1_id, user2_id
)
SELECT
user1_id,
user2_id
FROM cte2 WHERE common_cnt = (SELECT MAX(common_cnt) FROM cte2);
```
