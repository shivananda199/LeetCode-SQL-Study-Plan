Table: Calls
```
+--------------+----------+
| Column Name  | Type     |
+--------------+----------+
| caller_id    | int      |
| recipient_id | int      |
| call_time    | datetime |
+--------------+----------+
(caller_id, recipient_id, call_time) is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the time of a phone call between caller_id and recipient_id.
```
 

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of the users whose first and last calls on any day were with the same person. Calls are counted regardless of being the caller or the recipient.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Calls table:
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+
| caller_id | recipient_id | call_time           |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+
| 8         | 4            | 2021-08-24 17:46:07 |
| 4         | 8            | 2021-08-24 19:57:13 |
| 5         | 1            | 2021-08-11 05:28:44 |
| 8         | 3            | 2021-08-17 04:04:15 |
| 11        | 3            | 2021-08-17 13:07:00 |
| 8         | 11           | 2021-08-17 22:22:22 |
+-----------+--------------+---------------------+
Output: 
+---------+
| user_id |
+---------+
| 1       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
| 8       |
+---------+
Explanation: 
On 2021-08-24, the first and last call of this day for user 8 was with user 4. User 8 should be included in the answer.
Similarly, user 4 on 2021-08-24 had their first and last call with user 8. User 4 should be included in the answer.
On 2021-08-11, user 1 and 5 had a call. This call was the only call for both of them on this day. Since this call is the first and last call of the day for both of them, they should both be included in the answer.

Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# cte1: separate out date and time, recipient can also be considered caller, so we union second table with recipient as caller and caller as recipient
# cte2: find out first and last call times for each caller
# cte3: find out first and last recipient
# final: fetch all caller_id where first and last recipients are same
WITH cte1 AS (
    SELECT caller_id, recipient_id,

    UNION
