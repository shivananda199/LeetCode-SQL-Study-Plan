Table: Candidates
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| employee_id | int  |
| experience  | enum |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
employee_id is the primary key column for this table.
experience is an enum with one of the values ('Senior', 'Junior').
Each row of this table indicates the id of a candidate, their monthly salary, and their experience.
The salary of each candidate is guaranteed to be unique.
```
 

A company wants to hire new employees. The budget of the company for the salaries is $70000. The company's criteria for hiring are:

    Keep hiring the senior with the smallest salary until you cannot hire any more seniors.
    Use the remaining budget to hire the junior with the smallest salary.
    Keep hiring the junior with the smallest salary until you cannot hire any more juniors.

Write an SQL query to find the ids of seniors and juniors hired under the mentioned criteria.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input:
Candidates table:
+-------------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | experience | salary |
+-------------+------------+--------+
| 1           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 9           | Junior     | 15000  |
| 2           | Senior     | 20000  |
| 11          | Senior     | 16000  |
| 13          | Senior     | 50000  |
| 4           | Junior     | 40000  |
+-------------+------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 11          |
| 2           |
| 1           |
| 9           |

Explanation: 
We can hire 2 seniors with IDs (11, 2). Since the budget is $70000 and the sum of their salaries is $36000, we still have $34000 but they are not enough to hire the senior candidate with ID 13.
We can hire 2 juniors with IDs (1, 9). Since the remaining budget is $34000 and the sum of their salaries is $25000, we still have $9000 but they are not enough to hire the junior candidate with ID 4.

Example 2:
```
Input:
Candidates table:
+-------------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | experience | salary |
+-------------+------------+--------+
| 1           | Junior     | 25000  |
| 9           | Junior     | 10000  |
| 2           | Senior     | 85000  |
| 11          | Senior     | 80000  |
| 13          | Senior     | 90000  |
| 4           | Junior     | 30000  |
+-------------+------------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 9           |
| 1           |
| 4           |
+-------------+
Explanation: 
We cannot hire any seniors with the current budget as we need at least $80000 to hire one senior.
We can hire all three juniors with the remaining budget.

Solution
- keep adding senior employees starting with those having low salaries, keep track of running sum of their salaries
- when senior employees running sum crosses the budget, start adding junior employees with low salaries
- when junior employees running sum + sum(senior employee salaries considered so far) crosses budget, stop
- IFNULL(MAX(running_sum), 0) in the last WHERE clause - to account for cases when all senior candidates have their salaries higher then the budget
```
WITH temp1 AS (
    SELECT
    employee_id,
    experience,
    salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary) AS running_sum
    FROM Candidates
)
SELECT 
employee_id 
FROM temp1
WHERE (experience='Senior' AND running_sum<=70000)
OR (
    experience='Junior' 
    AND (
        running_sum + 
        (SELECT IFNULL(MAX(running_sum), 0) FROM temp1 
        WHERE experience='Senior' AND running_sum <= 70000)
    )<=70000
);
```
Method 2 - using UNION
```
WITH temp1 AS (
    SELECT
    employee_id,
    experience,
    salary,
    SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY experience ORDER BY salary) AS running_sum
    FROM Candidates
)

SELECT 
employee_id 
FROM temp1
WHERE experience='Senior' AND running_sum<=70000

UNION

SELECT employee_id FROM temp1
WHERE experience='Junior' 
AND (
    running_sum + 
    (SELECT IFNULL(MAX(running_sum), 0) FROM temp1 
    WHERE experience='Senior' AND running_sum <= 70000)
)<=70000;
```
