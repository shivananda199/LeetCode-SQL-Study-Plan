Table: Employee
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| company      | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the company and the salary of one employee.
```
 

Write an SQL query to find the rows that contain the median salary of each company. While calculating the median, when you sort the salaries of the company, break the ties by id.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 1  | A       | 2341   |
| 2  | A       | 341    |
| 3  | A       | 15     |
| 4  | A       | 15314  |
| 5  | A       | 451    |
| 6  | A       | 513    |
| 7  | B       | 15     |
| 8  | B       | 13     |
| 9  | B       | 1154   |
| 10 | B       | 1345   |
| 11 | B       | 1221   |
| 12 | B       | 234    |
| 13 | C       | 2345   |
| 14 | C       | 2645   |
| 15 | C       | 2645   |
| 16 | C       | 2652   |
| 17 | C       | 65     |
+----+---------+--------+
Output: 
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 5  | A       | 451    |
| 6  | A       | 513    |
| 12 | B       | 234    |
| 9  | B       | 1154   |
| 14 | C       | 2645   |
+----+---------+--------+
Explanation: 
For company A, the rows sorted are as follows:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 3  | A       | 15     |
| 2  | A       | 341    |
| 5  | A       | 451    | <-- median
| 6  | A       | 513    | <-- median
| 1  | A       | 2341   |
| 4  | A       | 15314  |
+----+---------+--------+
For company B, the rows sorted are as follows:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 8  | B       | 13     |
| 7  | B       | 15     |
| 12 | B       | 234    | <-- median
| 11 | B       | 1221   | <-- median
| 9  | B       | 1154   |
| 10 | B       | 1345   |
+----+---------+--------+
For company C, the rows sorted are as follows:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 17 | C       | 65     |
| 13 | C       | 2345   |
| 14 | C       | 2645   | <-- median
| 15 | C       | 2645   | 
| 16 | C       | 2652   |
+----+---------+--------+
```

Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH row_num_tbl AS (
    SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company ORDER BY salary) rk,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY company) AS cnt
    FROM Employee
),
median_row_num_tbl AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
    company,
    CASE WHEN cnt%2=0 THEN cnt/2 ELSE (FLOOR(cnt/2) + 1) END AS first_median_row_num,
    (FLOOR(cnt/2) + 1) AS second_median_row_num
    FROM row_num_tbl
)
SELECT DISTINCT
r.id,
r.company,
r.salary
FROM row_num_tbl r
JOIN median_row_num_tbl m ON r.company = m.company
AND r.rk IN (first_median_row_num, second_median_row_num);
