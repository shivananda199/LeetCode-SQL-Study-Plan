Table: Numbers
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
| frequency   | int  |
+-------------+------+
num is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table shows the frequency of a number in the database.
```
 

The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample.

Write an SQL query to report the median of all the numbers in the database after decompressing the Numbers table. Round the median to one decimal point.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Numbers table:
+-----+-----------+
| num | frequency |
+-----+-----------+
| 0   | 7         |
| 1   | 1         |
| 2   | 3         |
| 3   | 1         |
+-----+-----------+
Output: 
+--------+
| median |
+--------+
| 0.0    |
+--------+
Explanation: 
If we decompress the Numbers table, we will get [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3], so the median is (0 + 0) / 2 = 0.
```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
# Method 1:
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
    SELECT num, 1 AS frn FROM Numbers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT num, frn + 1 AS frn FROM cte 
    WHERE frn + 1 <= (SELECT frequency FROM Numbers n WHERE n.num=cte.num)
),
rnt AS (
    SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY num) AS rn,
    COUNT(*) OVER () AS cnt
    FROM cte
),
mrn AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
    CASE WHEN cnt%2=0 THEN cnt/2 ELSE (FLOOR(cnt/2) + 1) END AS first_median_row_num,
    (FLOOR(cnt/2) + 1) AS second_median_row_num
    FROM rnt
)
SELECT
ROUND(AVG(num), 1) AS median
FROM rnt r
JOIN mrn m
ON r.rn IN (m.first_median_row_num, m.second_median_row_num);
```
Method 2: Easy trick found in solutions

- Let's take all numbers from left including current number and then do same for right.
- (select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number<=n.Number) as left
(select sum(Frequency) from Numbers where Number<=n.Number) as right
- Now if difference between Left and Right less or equal to Frequency of the current number that means this number is median.
Ok, what if we get two numbers satisfied this condition? - take AVG().

```
SELECT 
AVG(n.num) AS median
FROM Numbers n
WHERE n.Frequency >= ABS((SELECT SUM(frequency) FROM Numbers WHERE num<=n.num) -
                         (SELECT sum(Frequency) FROM Numbers WHERE num>=n.num));
```
Method 3 - most efficient
```
# Idea: median frequency value will be between lower frequency number (running sum of frequency - frequency of that value) and upper frequency number (running sum of frequency) of a value
#---------------------------
#   n   f   |   l   u   mn
#---------------------------
#   0   7   |   0   7   6
#   1   1   |   7   8   6
#   2   3   |   8   11  6
#   3   1   |   11  12  6
#---------------------------
with a as (
    select num,
           sum(frequency) over (order by num) - frequency as lower_num,
           sum(frequency) over (order by num) as upper_num,
           sum(frequency) over () / 2 as median_num
    from Numbers 
)
select avg(num) as median
from a
where median_num between lower_num and upper_num;
