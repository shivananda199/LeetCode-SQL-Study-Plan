Table: Student
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| name        | varchar |
| continent   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the continent they came from.
```
 

A school has students from Asia, Europe, and America.

Write an SQL query to pivot the continent column in the Student table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent. The output headers should be America, Asia, and Europe, respectively.

The test cases are generated so that the student number from America is not less than either Asia or Europe.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: 
Student table:
+--------+-----------+
| name   | continent |
+--------+-----------+
| Jane   | America   |
| Pascal | Europe    |
| Xi     | Asia      |
| Jack   | America   |
+--------+-----------+
Output: 
+---------+------+--------+
| America | Asia | Europe |
+---------+------+--------+
| Jack    | Xi   | Pascal |
| Jane    | null | null   |
+---------+------+--------+
```
Solution
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
MAX(CASE WHEN continent = 'America' THEN name END) AS America,
MAX(CASE WHEN continent = 'Asia' THEN name END) AS Asia,
MAX(CASE WHEN continent = 'Europe' THEN name END) AS Europe  
FROM (
    SELECT *, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) AS row_id 
    FROM Student
) AS t
GROUP BY row_id;

# Method 2- pivot table - works in MS SQL
select [America],[Asia],[Europe]
from
(select name,continent,ROW_NUMBER() over(partition by continent order by name) as rownum from Student) p
pivot
(
min(name)
for continent in ([America],[Asia],[Europe])
) as pvt

```
